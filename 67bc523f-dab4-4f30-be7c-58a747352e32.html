					<p><i><b>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</b></i> is a 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter game</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Ward">Infinity Ward</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer_Games">Sledgehammer Games</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>. The game was released worldwide in November 8 2011 for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">OS X</a>. It is the sequel to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a></i> (2009), serving as the third and final installment in the original <i>Modern Warfare</i> trilogy and the eighth <i>Call of Duty</i> installment overall. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_3_–_Defiance">separate version</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS">Nintendo DS</a> was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Space">n-Space</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch">Treyarch</a> developed the game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> port. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix">Square Enix</a> published the game with a separate subtitled and dubbed version.</p>

<p>The game's campaign follows <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> and begins right after the events of its final mission. Similar to <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>, it is centered on Task Force 141, which contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Price">Captain Price</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_MacTavish">Soap MacTavish</a>, and a newly introduced playable character, Yuri. Alongside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force">Delta Force</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service">Special Air Service</a>, they hunt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Makarov_(Call_of_Duty)">Vladimir Makarov</a> (the main antagonist of the trilogy), a Russian terrorist who leads the Russian Ultranationalist party. He led several terror attacks across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">Europe</a>, triggering a large-scale war between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalism">Ultranationalists</a> and friendly forces. For the game's multiplayer mode, new mode types and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killstreak">killstreak</a> choices were brought in. Improvements were also made to the mode that solved issues that appeared in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>.</p>

<p>Using an enhanced version of <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IW_engine">IW engine</a>, development for the game began in 2010 with more than one developer studio. Prior to development, Infinity Ward co-founders Jason West and Vince Zampella left the company to form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respawn_Entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>. Other members had been fired or had left the company following the duo's departure. Sledgehammer Games had joined the <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> development force, with Raven Software also developing the game's multiplayer mode. Following a large leak containing detailed information about the game, multiple teaser trailers were released, with each showcasing a location featured in the game's campaign, leading up to a full reveal.</p>

<p><i>Modern Warfare 3</i> received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its gameplay, campaign, and multiplayer, although there was some criticism for its story and lack of innovation.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p><i>Modern Warfare 3</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a> video game much like its predecessors. <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedicated_server">dedicated server</a> support.</p>

<h3>Campaign</h3>

<p>The player assumes the role of various characters during the single-player campaign, changing perspectives throughout the progression of the story, which, like its predecessors, is divided into three sets of missions called "Acts". Each mission in an act features a series of objectives that are displayed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display_(video_gaming)">heads up display</a>, which marks the direction and distance between such objectives and the player. Damage to the player is shown by the visualization of blood-spatter or red-outs on the screen. The player's health regenerates over time as long as the player character avoids taking damage for a limited time. Mission objectives vary in their requirements, ranging from having the player arrive at a particular checkpoint, to eliminating enemies in a specified location, to standing their ground against enemy squadrons, directing remote-operated weapons, and planting explosive charges on enemy installations. The player is also accompanied by fellow soldiers who cannot be issued orders. Like its predecessor, the game includes an interactive scene of a terror attack against civilians, which the player is given the option of skipping due to the portrayal of graphic and potentially upsetting content, including harm to children.</p>

<p><i>Modern Warfare 3</i> features a new mode, called Survival. This mode allows between one and two players to fight massive waves of enemies, with each wave becoming increasingly difficult. It differs from the Nazi Zombies mode in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War">Call of Duty: World at War</a></i>, principally in that enemies no longer spawn at fixed locations as the zombies do, but instead appear at tactical positions based on the current location of the player. The mode is available on all multiplayer maps in the game. Players earn in-game cash for items such as weapons, upgrades, ammo, air/ground support, and equipment if they kill or assist in killing enemies, while more items can be unlocked by earning XP which is also increased by killing enemies. <i>Special Ops</i> also returns from <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>. These challenge missions feature up to 48 stars, unlike its previous installment, which featured 69. Some weapons in Spec Ops are exclusive to that game mode and are not available for play in multiplayer mode.</p>

<p>The entire <i>Killstreak</i> reward system has been altered to make it more difficult for players to get early unlocks. Killstreaks are now known as <i>Pointstreaks</i>, and kills are no longer the only way to increase the player's point streak. Completing objectives such as planting a bomb or capturing a flag in <i>Capture The Flag</i> awards points towards the player's Pointstreak. Pointstreak rewards are organized into three different "strike packages" called <i>Assault</i>, <i>Support</i>, and <i>Specialist</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Assault</i> strike package works the same as the Killstreak reward system in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> and <i>Black Ops</i>: the player must earn more and more points without dying. Once the player is killed, their points are reset to zero. Likewise, the <i>Specialist</i> strike package rewards players with perks after every second consecutive kill. Upon death, however, the player loses all the perks and the points are reset to zero. In contrast, the <i>Support</i> strike package is awarded based on the total points that the player has earned over the entire match, regardless of how often the player dies. If a player switches to a custom class with a different reward system (either <i>assault</i> or <i>specialist</i>) during gameplay, all points are automatically reset to 0. Players are allowed to choose which Pointstreak rewards they want to use when they gain it during the match, rather than choosing them between rounds.</p>

<p>Along with revamping the entire Killstreak reward system, <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> also has a completely modified Ranking and Unlocks system, which does not use a currency system for unlocks. The player's primary weapon levels up alongside the player, and unlocks a number of "Proficiency" perks such as <i>Attachments</i>, (allows two attachments and is a successor to the "Bling" and "Warlord" perks), <i>Kick</i> (reduced recoil while aiming down the player's sight) and <i>Focus</i> (reduced flinching while under fire). Only one Proficiency can be put on a primary weapon. Another new addition is the ability to equip "Hybrid Scopes" on a weapon, such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_weapon_sight">holographic sight</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dot_magnifier">red dot magnifier</a>, allowing players to switch between magnified and non-magnified. <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> introduces a new "Prestige Shop" which will unlock only after the player has selected the option to prestige for the first time. The "Prestige Shop" allows Prestige players to use tokens they gain from using the Prestige option to buy exclusive features such as double XP and an extra custom weapon class. The player is able to Prestige 20 times.</p>

<p>Several controversial perks in <i>Modern Warfare 2</i>, accused of being too overpowered, have been removed in <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>. Diving from standing to prone, known as "dolphin diving", has been removed due to balancing issues. <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> utilized Treyarch's hot fix system to fix bugs and glitches. <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> features a local and online split-screen option. (Not available for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> version.)</p>

<p>New game modes were added:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kill Confirmed: players must collect floating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_tag">dog tags</a> from the corpse of a downed enemy before the kill can be registered. However, the opposing team can pick up the dog tag as well to deny the other team a kill, which denies the other team a point.</li>
  <li>Team Defender: both teams attempt to capture a flag dropped by the first person who is killed when the match starts, the team of the person who holds the flag will get double points for their kills; while the team without the flag only gets the default number per kill.</li>
  <li>Private matches also now include pre-made game modes including: "Infected" (where the infected kill enemies to recruit them to their team), "Drop Zone" (where the player must hold a drop zone for points and care packages), "Team Juggernaut" (each team plays alongside an AI Juggernaut character), "Gun Game" (be the first to get one kill with every gun in the game), "One in the Chamber" (in which players are only allowed one pistol with one bullet and three lives where they can only get more bullets by killing other players), and "Juggernaut" (free for all against a juggernaut, kill the juggernaut to become it). Along with this, players are allowed to create their own game modes with customized settings such as number of players and time limit.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Special Ops game mode from <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> is present in <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>, and includes new features which make it more replayable and similar to other game modes, such as Nazi Zombies from previous <i>Call of Duty</i> games, and Hordes from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War">Gears of War</a></i>. The two main Special Ops modes include one that is generally the same as the last Modern Warfare game, and a new wave-based game, Survival, where the player is inserted into a multiplayer map alone or with a single partner and defends an area against waves of enemies. The players can buy support options unlocked with money earned during each round via the means of killing the enemy and completing the optional objectives on each wave, which vary from getting multi-kills to not taking damage. You gain experience for killing them which allows for more weapons to be unlocked, as well as other support options. The model also works with the DLC multiplayer maps.</p>

<p><i>Call of Duty: Elite</i> was an online service developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beachhead_Studios">Beachhead Studios</a> for the multiplayer portion of <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> (as well as the previous installment in the series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops"><i> </i>Black Ops<i></i></a>). It was first showcased at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2011">E3 2011</a> and was released on November 8, 2011, to coincide with the release of <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>. The free version included features such as lifetime statistics and social networking integration. It included monthly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">downloadable content</a>. The service was shut down by Activision on February 28, 2014, and did not support <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Ghosts">Call of Duty: Ghosts</a></i>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) available for <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> is an assortment of additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer">multiplayer</a> maps, Special Ops missions, and Face-Off Maps that came as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Elite">Call of Duty ELITE</a> Premium membership. Downloadable content was split into four unique "Content Collections," each with 2-3 content packs.</p>

<p>During the release of <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> and <i>Call of Duty</i>'s <i>Elite</i> service, premium members of the service were promised 20 pieces of DLC over a 9-month period, with content releases for each platform every month. This number was increased to 22 on <i>Call of Duty</i>'s official Elite Content Calendar. Initially, all downloadable content was only available to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Elite">Call of Duty: Elite</a></i> premium members. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> users received all DLC about a month before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a> users regardless of Elite membership due to a special contract between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>. As an example, the first Collection dropped on Xbox 360 on January 24, and on February 28 on the PS3. Content Drops were released monthly exclusively to all <i>Call of Duty: Elite</i> premium and founder members. There were a total of 9 monthly DLC releases up until the end of <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>' 2012 content season. September was the last month DLC was released for Xbox 360, and October was the last month for PlayStation 3. Since <i>Call of Duty: Elite</i> was not available for PC gamers, DLC was only released in the form of Content Collections.</p>

<p>On May 9, 2012, it was announced that the Face-Off mode would be introduced to Modern Warfare 3. It included smaller maps, which promoted fast gameplay matches. Face-Off included options for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1v1">1v1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms">2v2</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms">3v3</a> battles. Two free Face-Off maps became available for all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live">Xbox Live</a> Gold subscribers on May 15, 2012, regardless of <i>Call of Duty: Elite</i> membership.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>The game sees the return of Task Force 141 members <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_MacTavish">Captain John "Soap" MacTavish</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McKidd">Kevin McKidd</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Price">Captain John Price</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Murray_(actor)">Billy Murray</a>) and Russian loyalist "Nikolai", who are on the run after killing the rogue General Shepherd, the main antagonist of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2#Plot">the previous game</a>. Task Force 141 was officially disavowed due to Shepherd's death, with the truth of his involvement in igniting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III">World War III</a> known only to Price, Soap, and Nikolai. For most of the game, the player controls Yuri, an ex-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spetsnaz_GRU">Spetsnaz</a> operator and former associate of Russian Ultranationalist terrorist Makarov, who joins Task Force 141 on their hunt for Makarov, who returns as the game's main antagonist. Several playable characters have been added, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force">Delta Force</a> operator Staff Sergeant Derek "Frost" Westbrook; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service">Special Air Service</a> Sergeant Marcus Burns; and Andrei Harkov, a Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Protective_Service_(Russia)">FGS</a> agent tasked with protecting the Russian President. Just like President Al-Fulani in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">the first game</a>, Soap is only "playable" during the game's opening sequence; while Price becomes the player character in the game's final mission, and is the only character in the trilogy who speaks while playable. The player also takes brief control of a civilian tourist in London, seconds before he and his family are killed by a chemical agent; as well as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_AC-130">AC-130</a> TV Operator during the Battle of Paris.</p>

<p>New non-player characters (NPCs) include Delta Force operatives "Sandman" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fichtner">William Fichtner</a>), "Truck" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Elba">Idris Elba</a>), and "Grinch" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Olyphant">Timothy Olyphant</a>), who serve as Frost's squadmates. Captain MacMillan briefly returns from <i>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</i> as Baseplate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Fairbrass">Craig Fairbrass</a>, who originally voiced the characters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare#Characters">Gaz</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Riley">Ghost</a>, returns to voice SAS operative Sergeant Wallcroft, who originally had a minor role in the first <i>Modern Warfare</i>.</p>

<p>Locations featured in the game include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>.</p>

<p>In August 2016, Soap (Brandon Hughes) and Price (Kobi Hughes) are extracted by Nikolai to a safe house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a>, but are soon attacked by Makarov's forces. At Price's request, Nikolai contacts his "best man," a former Spetsnaz operator named Yuri, with a common grudge against Makarov.</p>

<p>Concurrently, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Force">Delta Force</a> squad codenamed "Metal" assists the defending American forces in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a> from the Russian military. After taking down a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">radio jammer</a> atop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange_Building">New York Stock Exchange Building</a>, Team Metal aids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_SEALs">Navy SEALs</a> in hijacking an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_II-class_submarine">Oscar II-class submarine</a> and using its missile payload to destroy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Navy">Russian Navy</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Bay">New York Bay</a>. With air superiority reestablished and the enemy fleet destroyed, the United States goes on the offensive. As a result, Russia withdraws all its forces from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States">East Coast</a>.</p>

<p>Three months later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia">Russian President</a> Boris Vorshevsky flies to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Hamburg</a> to take part in peace talks with the United States protected by Harkov. However, his security detail is ambushed by Makarov’s forces aboard the plane, forcing it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing">crash land</a>. They assault the crash site, kill Harkov and the remaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Protective_Service_(Russia)">FGS</a> agents guarding Vorshevsky, and kidnap him. Makarov demands he relinquish Russia's nuclear launch codes, threatening his daughter's life if he does not comply. Additionally, Makarov smuggles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon">chemical bombs</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone">Sierra Leone</a> to several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> member capital cities and military bases, with Task Force 141 failing to prevent the deadly cargo from leaving the country. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service">SAS</a> identify one of the bombs as it is shipped into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a> but are unable to intervene in time as it detonates, along with the rest across the continent. With NATO crippled by the attacks, Russia, now under Makarov's control, invades Europe.</p>

<p>Team Metal rescues the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States">Vice President of the United States</a> in Hamburg while NATO scrambles to repel the Russians. Task Force 141 acquires a lead from MacMillan that a Somali <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market">black market</a> warlord named Waraabe is associated with the chemical weapons. The team assaults his compound in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosaso">Bosaso</a>, cornering and interrogating the warlord into revealing that a man, Viktor "Volk" Khristenko, CEO of Ultranationalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_organization">front company</a> Fregata Industries, was responsible for constructing the bombs and is located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a>. Price then executes Waraabe and relays the intelligence to Team Metal, who are deployed to capture Volk with assistance from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGN">GIGN</a>. Volk is captured, and under interrogation, he reveals that Makarov is meeting with his associates in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a>. Price, Soap, and Yuri infiltrate the city, but the meeting turns out to be a trap, during which Sergeant Kamarov, a Russian loyalist and close contact with Price, is killed by Makarov, who addresses Yuri as "his friend." In the ensuing fight, Soap suffers an injury that causes the knife wound he sustained while fighting with Shepherd to reopen; he dies of blood loss just after revealing Makarov's association with Yuri to Price.</p>

<p>An enraged Price interrogates Yuri at gunpoint, demanding to know his past with Makarov. Yuri explains that he was present in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pripyat">Pripyat</a> during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ghillied_Up">Zakhaev's attempted assassination</a> in 1996 and became disillusioned with the Ultranationalist cause following the nuclear detonation in the Middle East in 2011, with Makarov revealed to have personally detonated the bomb. Yuri attempted to thwart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Russian">the massacre at Zakhaev International Airport</a> but was critically wounded by Makarov upon learning of his betrayal before being rescued by security forces. After learning this, Price begrudgingly continues to work with Yuri. Receiving further help from MacMillan, the two infiltrate Makarov's castle base in rural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic">Czech Republic</a> to acquire intel on his whereabouts, learning that he has located President Vorshevsky's daughter, Alena, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin">Berlin</a> and intends to kidnap her. Price relays the intelligence to Team Metal, who despite assistance from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeswehr">Bundeswehr</a>, fail to reach her before Makarov's men capture her. They track her and the President to a diamond mine in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia">Siberia</a>, launching a rescue operation with Task Force 141. Team Metal sacrifices themselves to hold off Makarov's forces long enough for Vorshevsky, Alena, and 141 to escape as the mine collapses on top of them. With the President safe and Makarov's machinations publicly revealed, relations between Russia and the U.S. come to peace, the war in Europe ends, and Makarov goes into hiding.</p>

<p>By January 2017, Price, Nikolai, and Yuri have tracked Makarov to a hotel in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai">Dubai</a>. Price and Yuri don modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_suit">EOD suits</a> to assault the building, cornering Makarov on the rooftop. He gains the upper hand in the ensuing struggle and prepares to execute Price but is distracted by Yuri, whom he kills. Price then tackles Makarov and wraps a steel cable around his neck before plunging him through a skylight, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging">hanging</a> him. A victorious Price then lights a cigar as first responders approach the hotel.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>On August 24, 2011, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a>-owned brand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Dew">Mountain Dew</a> officially announced on their Facebook page that they would be promoting the game with their "Game Fuel" soda variants, which would be cherry-citrus-flavored (the original Game Fuel that promoted <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3">Halo 3</a></i> in 2007 and brought back in 2009 to promote <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a></i>) and Tropical-flavored (a new flavor that was tested by 500 Dew Labs members). The drinks featured codes to give the player double experience points in-game, depending on the size of the drink. Another PepsiCo-owned brand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doritos">Doritos</a>, promoted the game with its "Cool Ranch" and "Nacho Cheese" flavors and also followed the same rules as the Mountain Dew promotion. Both promotions started on October 10, 2011, and ended on December 31, 2011.

It featured many things including the reveal of the new multiplayer which attendees were able to play for the first time. In addition, all attendees received the Hardened Edition for free as a gift for attending. At a <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> VIP party in Amsterdam, Dutch porn star and avid fan of the series Kim Holland was originally invited to attend the event until she was suddenly uninvited when Activision discovered her profession. In her blog, she shared her opinion and feelings towards Activision's sudden decision, writing: "People murdering people is neat, [...] but love-makers are dirty?" Activision did not respond to any comments about the subject.</p>

<p>Activision had planned to set up an official website to promote the game, however, the domain name "ModernWarfare3.com" had already been taken and was used for an anti-<i>Call of Duty</i> website and redirecting users to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts">Electronic Arts</a>'s game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_3">Battlefield 3</a></i>. Activision filed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US</a>$2,600 complaint against the site with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Arbitration_Forum">National Arbitration Forum</a>. On September 8, 2011, Activision won the complaint and acquired the rights to the domain name.

<h2>Release</h2>

<p>Two weeks before the release of the game, it was reported that half of the PC version had been uploaded online after being stolen from a warehouse in Fresno, California. Investigators working on behalf of Activision searched torrent websites for traces of the game as well as visiting people who had downloaded a copy across the United States and requested that they remove it or they would face a fine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US</a>$5,000.</p>

<p>As early as late October, reports were already surfacing about copies being sold early to people with gameplay videos uploaded online. On November 3, 2011, it was reported that copies of the game were already being sold early in the United States. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kmart_(United_States)">K-Mart</a> had already started selling copies of the game before its scheduled release date with copies already appearing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">eBay</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist">Craigslist</a>. This was due to an error made by one of the shipping companies that told Walmart to sell copies of the game immediately after receiving the shipments. However, Activision contacted K-mart about this and had the issue resolved.</p>

<p>French site <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TF1">TF1</a> News reported that a truck suffered a collision with a car on November 6, 2011, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Créteil">Créteil</a>, south <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</a>, before two masked individuals emerged from the car. The criminals reportedly used tear gas to neutralize the truck drivers before hopping in and making off with the video game shipment said to be worth 400,000 Euros. A separate report said the truck contained a delivery of 6000 copies of <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the game's release, a man from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Colorado">Aurora, Colorado</a> who did not receive a copy of the game at his local Best Buy, despite pre-ordering it, claimed to be so angry that he "could blow this place up". He was also reported as having threatened to shoot employees once they left the store. Lomon Sar, age 31, was issued a citation and court summons by police responding to the disturbance. The game was released for OS X on May 20, 2014.</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical response</h3>

<p><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> received "generally positive" reviews, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, except for the Wii, where it received "mixed or average" reviews.</p>

<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> gave the game's Xbox 360 version 5 stars out of 5, stating that even as "the series has always been renowned for elements like the excellent sound design, the gloss, polish, and compulsion of its gameplay," it is "a game that not only lives up to the brand hype but exceeds it. A game where the mass appeal is justified and the expectations are met." Gaming Evolution gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions a 9.0 out of 10, stating "Modern Warfare 3 lives up to the hype. It is proving itself the one of the best FPS the genre has to offer." <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN">IGN</a></i> gave the game's Xbox 360 version a 9.0 out of 10.0, pointing out that the game offers "great multiplayer, [a] fun campaign, tons of content, but [also] a forgettable story."</p>

<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot">GameSpot</a></i> qualifies its review, stating that "the series' signature thrills have lost some of their luster. <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> iterates rather than innovates, so the fun you have is familiar", but concludes by affirming that "fortunately, [the game is] also utterly engrossing and immensely satisfying, giving fans another reason to rejoice in this busy shooter season". <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a></i> gave the game an 8/10 noting that it is a "ferocious and satisfying game that knows exactly what players expect, and delivers on that promise with bullish confidence" but with "an outmoded single-player campaign".</p>

<p>Reviews for the Wii version of the game have been less favorable, with <i>IGN</i> rating it a 4.5 out of 10, noting the lacking graphics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_Connection">poor friend code system</a>.</p>

IGN attributed this as players' confusion between the two titles and confirmed Metacritic was in the process of removing these reviews.</p>

<p>Activision has said that it believes <i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> day-one shipments were the largest for any game ever. "The record number of pre-orders from <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> drove the largest day-one shipments in our history, and in the industry's history," said Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg during an earnings call on November 8, 2011.

To be exact, it has beaten theatrical box office, book, and video game sales records for five-day worldwide sell-through in dollars.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPD_Group">NPD Group</a>, <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> was November's biggest-selling game of the month in the U.S. <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> sales surpassed first-month sales of the 2010s <i>Black Ops</i> by 7 percent, and sales for November sit at around the 9 million unit mark.
