It was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_Software">Avalanche Software</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Iron_Studios">Heavy Iron Studios</a> with additional help from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Theory">Ninja Theory</a>, Studio Gobo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo_Digital">Sumo Digital</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Games">United Front Games</a>. It is the sequel to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Infinity_2.0">Disney Infinity 2.0</a></i> (2014). In contrast to its predecessor, which focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics_characters">Marvel Comics characters</a> and playsets, <i>3.0</i> has a focus on the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars">Star Wars</a></i> franchise. The game was announced on May 5, 2015, and was released on August 28, 2015 in Europe and on August 30, 2015 in North America.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p><i>Disney Infinity 3.0</i> features similar gameplay mechanics to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Infinity_(video_game)">Disney Infinity</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Infinity_2.0">Disney Infinity 2.0</a></i>. Although sharing many key elements, the game's combat system has been redesigned to become more in-depth and complex. The game's combat system is influenced by the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Unleashed">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</a></i> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Unleashed_II">its sequel</a>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> and most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>'s aerial combat-themed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_video_games">video game series</a> (except <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></i>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber">Lightsabers</a> have been integrated into combat, due to the inclusion of <i>Star Wars</i> characters. Characters who use lightsabers in combat can utilize additional weapons. For instance, playable character Luke Skywalker has the ability to use a blaster and a lightsaber, which used together can juggle enemies in the air. Full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combo_(video_gaming)">combos</a> have been integrated, which allows the player to pause mid-combo and branch off into another variation of the combo. Playable characters with the ability to use the Force, in <i>Star Wars</i> mythology, have the ability to push and pull enemies during combat. Special attacks, which were introduced in <i>Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes</i>, have returned. Only the bearer of a close-ranged weapon (such as lightsabers and other blade or staff weapons), including the characters who have their own primary close-ranged weapons (like Mulan, whose primary weapon is a staff,  similar to the Jedi and Sith's own primary lightsaber), and characters who can fly are able to perform an aerial combo. Instead of waiting for a progress bar to fill up for a special attack to be performed, a new feature allows the attack to be released early, but the effects of the attack are not as strong. Auto-lock when firing ranged weapons at targets has been enhanced, so players no longer have to move closer to enemies in order to auto-lock on their positions.</p>

<p>A playset based on <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_VII_-_The_Force_Awakens">Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens</a></i> was announced at the 2015 D23 Expo and released in December of that year as a tie-in to the movie; it features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_(Star_Wars)">Finn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_(Star_Wars)">Rey</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylo_Ren">Kylo Ren</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe_Dameron">Poe Dameron</a> as playable characters.</p>

<p>The Toy Box Takeover expansion game begins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse">Mickey</a> summoning his friends.

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Since <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Infinity_(video_game)">Disney Infinity</a></i>, there have been hints of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars">Star Wars</a></i> joining the line of games. The "ultimate unlocks" in the first two <i>Infinity</i> games were a lightsaber and a landspeeder, respectively. Prior to the release of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Infinity_2.0">Disney Infinity 2.0</a></i> in 2014, series producer John Vignocchi hinted that a future installment could have characters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a>. The title's existence was first revealed following a leak from Chinese retailer Taobao showing potential character and figure designs for the third installment. German retailer Saturn would later leak images of the game's Starter Pack featuring the characters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano">Ahsoka Tano</a> from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></i>. The game was officially revealed by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer">Game Informer</a></i> on May 5, 2015.</p>

<p>Studio Gobo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Theory">Ninja Theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_Games">United Front Games</a> were among development groups that worked on the game's Playsets. In order to create a more complex combat system, compared to the first two installments, Disney decided to also have Ninja Theory revamp the game's combat, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> had expressed interest in working with the company. United Front Games was chosen for their combat experience on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Dogs_(video_game)">Sleeping Dogs</a> to develop the Marvel Battlegrounds playset.</p>

<h2>Release</h2>

<p><i>Disney Infinity 3.0</i> was released on August 30, 2015 in North America. The Starter Pack, which includes the game disc, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano character figurines, one playset piece (Twilight of the Republic), one web card and the Disney Infinity Base, was released on the game's launch. The game also received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution_of_video_games">digital download</a> release. Exclusively in Europe, <i>Disney Infinity 3.0</i> had a game disc-only release without the figurines, web cards and Disney Infinity Base, that are included in the Starter Pack.</p>

<p>A Saga Bundle Starter Pack was available at launch for the PS3 and PS4. It contains the basic starter pack, Rise Against the Empire playset, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett">Boba Fett</a> figure. Boba Fett was a timed exclusive to this pack and was released on his own in March 2016.</p>

<p>Power Disc Packs, which unlock additional content in the game, are no longer sold in blind packs, contrary to the use of blind packs in the previous two games. Instead, power discs were released in identifiable packaging.</p>

<p>A special Power Disc based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>'s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> role was given out at Disney's 2015 D23 Expo. Controversially, it is an expo exclusive and was not sold in stores. Despite this, it does not affect a player's chance to get 100% completion.</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<p><i>Disney Infinity 3.0</i> received very positive reviews from video game critics who praised the refinements to the Toy Box, Play Sets, combat, and reduced bugs.</p>

<h3>End of non-console support</h3>

<p>Between the March 2016 releases of the <i>Marvel Battlegrounds</i> Play Set and the then-new Marvel and Baloo figures, and the cancellation of the <i>Disney Infinity</i> series, players of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game">mobile</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV">Apple TV</a> versions noticed that the game was not updated for those platforms to support the new figures or Play Set. The <i>Disney Infinity</i> account confirmed that the new content would be available on consoles.</p>

<p>Due to Disney's decision to shut down Avalanche Software and end its toys-to-life business, Disney began to gradually retire the <i>Disney Infinity</i> franchise, leaving it as a trilogy. On July 29, 2016, the in-game purchase system was completely removed for the Windows (except the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a> version), iOS, Android, and Apple TV versions of the game. Before they did, Disney closed its game without letting anyone know. On September 30, 2016, the Windows (standalone launcher version), Apple TV, Google, and Amazon versions of the game were removed from their respective online stores (and became unplayable), and new toybox submissions ceased to be accepted. The Steam versions of <i>2.0</i> and <i>3.0</i> were also taken down with Disney Interactive announcing that "Gold Editions" of all installments of the trilogy would be provided to allow continued use of the full games and all their content after the online servers are shut down. Anyone who purchased <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">downloadable content</a> for those versions in-game or via Steam received the "Gold Editions" for free, and any webcodes that were redeemed still apply. Disney released the "Gold Editions" of all three <i>Disney Infinity</i> games—including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Infinity_(video_game)">the first game</a>, which was previously never released either on Steam or in a full version (with playsets) on PC—on December 9, 2016 via Steam. The original Steam releases of the second and third games were completely delisted and disabled. On January 3, 2017, in-game purchases in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8">Windows 8</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10">10</a> versions (from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store">Windows Store</a>) were disabled as well. On the morning of March 3, 2017, in addition to the discontinuation of all aforementioned online services, Disney also shut down all officially related websites, including Online Profiles linked to Disney Accounts and the official forums. Apple TV and Windows 8/10 versions were unplayable as well on that day.</p>

<p>In October 2017, Disney quietly announced a series of action figures entitled "Toy Box" exclusive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Store">Disney Store</a> locations. The line consists of characters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_Animation_Studios">Pixar</a>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars">Star Wars</a></i>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics">Marvel</a> properties in their <i>Disney Infinity</i> designs.</p>
