					<p><i><b>Call of Duty: Mobile</b></i> is a 2019 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video game</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiMi_Studio_Group">TiMi Studio Group</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">iOS</a>. Released as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">free-to-play</a> title, it was one of the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game">mobile game</a> launches in history, generating over US$480 million with 270 million downloads within a year. <i>Call of Duty: Mobile</i> was published in other regions by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garena">Garena</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_Games">Tencent Games</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNG_Corporation">VNG Corporation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiMi_Studio_Group">TiMi Studio Group</a>.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The game's two primary modes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game">multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game">battle royale</a>. In each, players can choose to play ranked or non-ranked matches. Apart from standard matchmaking, a private room for both of these modes can also be accessed where players can invite and battle with their in-game friends. The game includes two types of in-game currencies: "Credits", which are earned through playing the game, and "COD Points", which are bought with real-world money. It is possible to play the full game without paying, though some exclusive character and weapon skins can only be bought with COD Points.</p>

<h3>Multiplayer</h3>

<p>The multiplayer mode is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a> similar to previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty"><i>Call of Duty</i> games</a>. The game also has 'Scorestreaks,' which are special weapons that become available as the player reaches certain point thresholds.. The primary modes which the game features include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Deathmatch">Team Deathmatch</a>, Frontline, Domination, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy and Kill Confirmed. Additionally, the game features special and limited multiplayer modes that last for varying lengths of time. These include: <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_Hunt">Prop Hunt</a></i>, <i>Rapid Fire</i>, <i>Sticks and Stones</i>, <i>2v2</i>, <i>Capture the Flag</i>, <i>One Shot One Kill</i>, <i>Snipers Only</i>, <i>Gun Game</i>, and <i>Attack of the Undead</i> among others.</p>

<p>The game also includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game">battle royale</a> modes featuring up to 100 players. Players can choose to play solo, in a duo, or in a four-man squad. At the start of a match, all players choose an ability from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healing">healing</a> to making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_pad">launch pad</a>. Once all 100 players are ready, they board a transport plane that flies across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map">map</a> in a randomized trajectory. This flight path changes every game. Every team is automatically given a jump leader who decides when and where the team will land, However, players can choose to break away and jump independently if they prefer.</p>

<p>Each player starts with a knife as their only weapon. Scattered across the map are various weapons, vehicles, and equipment that players can use to eliminate enemies and increase their chances of survival. The mode has high tier loot zones (marked in yellow on the map) that provide players with better items. The safe zone gradually shrinks as the match progresses, forcing players to move inward. Those who remain outside the zone for too long will take continuous damage and eventually be eliminated. The last surviving player or team wins the match. Battle royale also has limited modes like Sniper Challenge, Battle Royale Alcatraz, Battle Royale Blackout, 20v20 Warfare, and Battle Royale Blitz. The game also features an MP/BR hybrid mode known as Ground War: Skirmish.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Revive System:</b> Some battle royale modes allow players to revive teammates if they collect their dog tags within a limited time.</li>
  <li><b>Airdrops:</b> Supply drops periodically fall from the sky, containing rare weapons, armor, and perks.</li>
  <li><b>Classes:</b> Players can choose from different character classes, such as Scout, Ninja, Medic, Defender, and more, each with unique abilities.</li>
  <li><b>Boss Fights:</b> Some maps include AI-controlled bosses, such as the Butcher, which drop high-tier loot when defeated.</li>
  <li><b>Vehicles:</b> The game features land, air, and water vehicles, such as ATVs, helicopters, and boats, which help players traverse the map quickly.</li>
  <li><b>Customization:</b> Players can modify their loadouts with custom weapons, perks, and attachments before the match begins.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie">Zombies</a> mode was added in November 2019. It featured one map called Shi No Numa. It placed teams of players against zombies that attacked in waves. It was playable in <i>Endless Survival Mode</i>, which ran like the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War">Call of Duty: World at War</a> experience, and <i>Raid Mode</i>, which threw a set number of waves at the players before transitioning to a boss encounter. The players could choose whether to play it on Normal or Heroic difficulty. The mode was removed in March 2020 due to it not reaching the desired level of quality. This mode was added back to the game in October 2022, again only featuring the Shi No Numa map.</p>

<p>Undead Siege, a zombie survival mode, was added into the game in August 2021. In it, a team of four players have to survive and protect their teleportation device from continuous waves of zombies.
