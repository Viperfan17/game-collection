					<p><i><b>Skylanders: Swap Force</b></i> (stylized as <i><b>Skylanders: SWAP Force</b></i>) is a 2013
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game">platform game</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_Visions">Vicarious Visions</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beenox">Beenox</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>. It is the third main game in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylanders">Skylanders</a></i> video game and toy franchise, following 2012's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylanders:_Giants">Skylanders: Giants</a></i>, which was a direct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel">sequel</a> to 2011's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylanders:_Spyro's_Adventure">Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure</a></i>.</p>

<p>It is the first <i>Skylanders</i> game to be released in North America before other regions, unlike the previous two games where Australia got the installments first. It is also the first <i>Skylanders</i> game not to be owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi">Vivendi</a>.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>The gameplay of <i>SWAP Force</i> is based on the two previous games, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylanders:_Spyro's_Adventure">Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylanders:_Giants">Skylanders: Giants</a>,</i> but unlike them Skylanders now have the ability to jump. Players use a portal to bring real-life figures into the game; <i>SWAP Force introduces a</i> new Portal of Power that has new technology that makes the SWAP Force characters work correctly. The SWAP Force characters have top and bottom halves that can be separated from each other and recombined with halves from other characters. In total, there are 256 combinations between the top and bottom halves. The SWAP Force characters also have eight distinct ways of moving, which are necessary to enter side areas called "SWAP Zone Challenges". These are Rocket, Spin, Dig, Stealth, Teleportation, Bounce, Speed and Climb.</p>

<h2>Plot</h2>

<h3>Premise</h3>

<p>For years, the SWAP Force protected the volcano that replenishes Skylands' magic every hundred years. However, following a battle, they were caught in the eruption, which blasted them apart, sent them to Earth, and gave them the ability to swap powers. The Skylanders must prevent the Elementals from being evilized, stop Kaos, and save the Skylands.</p>

<p><i>SWAP Force</i> features sixteen new core characters and sixteen new swappable characters, in addition to sixteen reposed Skylanders from previous games. The sixteen new swappable characters are Wash Buckler, Blast Zone, Free Ranger, Freeze Blade, Night Shift, Magna Charge, Stink Bomb, Rattle Shake, Hoot Loop, Trap Shadow, Grilla Drilla, Spy Rise, Rubble Rouser, Doom Stone, Boom Jet and Fire Kraken.  The sixteen new core characters are Bumble Blast, Countdown, Dune Bug, Fryno, Grim Creeper, Pop Thorn, Punk Shock, Rip Tide, Roller Brawl, Scorp, Scratch, Slobber Tooth, Smolderdash, Star Strike, Wind Up, and Zoo Lou.</p>

<p>Every 100 years, the Elementals, a group of four ancient creatures consisting of the Flashfin, the Terrasquid, the Frost Hound, and the Tree Spirit, unite to replenish the Skylands' magic through Mount Cloudbreak. During the last eruption ceremony, Kaos' mother Kaossandra tried to destroy the volcano, but a team of Skylanders defended it. Following the volcano's eruption, they were sent to Earth and gained the ability to swap their tops and bottoms, transforming them into the SWAP Force.</p>

<p>100 years later, Captain Flynn goes to see the eruption and finds a girl named Tessa, who is being pursued by a fleet of monsters called Greebles and explains her home is in danger. Although he succeeds in driving them off with help from the Skylanders, his ship is damaged in the crash. Afterwards, Flynn and Tessa arrive at her home village of Woodburrow and meet the village crier, Rufus. They learn that the chieftess has been captured and Kaos has obtained a device called the Evilizer, which uses Petrified Darkness to turn others into stronger and more aggressive crystal versions of themselves.</p>

<p>The Skylanders rescue the chieftess and bring her back to the village. However, Kaos has learned of the Elemental's whereabouts and plans to evilize one of them, which will cause Mount Cloudbreak to turn evil and spread Darkness across Skylands. Glumshanks begins to doubt Kaos's ability to take over the Skylands, so Kaos evilizes him and sends him to his dig site. Tessa leads the Skylanders to Mudwater Hollow, the location of the Flashfin, to stop Kaos from evilizing it. They make their way to Kaos' dig site and stop the operation; in the process, they defeat Glumshanks and turn him back to normal.</p>

<p>Glumshanks returns to Kaos, who is disappointed by his failure, and is greeted by Kaossandra, who mocks him for his incompetence. The Skylanders attempt to find the Terrasquid and make their way to the town of Motleyville hoping to get help from its baron, Sharpfin. When they arrive, Baron Von Shellshock, a servant of Kaos, evilizes Tessa's bird Whiskers and sends him to attack them. After dealing with Shellshock and turning Whiskers back to normal, Sharpfin promises to help the Skylanders find the Terrasquid and sends his crew to fix Flynn's ship.
