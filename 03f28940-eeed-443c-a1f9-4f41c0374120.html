					<p><i><b>Halo 4</b></i> is a 2012 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a> video game developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/343_Industries">343 Industries</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Studios">Microsoft Studios</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console">video game console</a>. <i>Halo 4</i>'s story follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genetic_enhancement">genetically</a> enhanced human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersoldier">supersoldier</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Chief_(Halo)">Master Chief</a>, and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> construct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(Halo)">Cortana</a>, as they encounter unknown threats while exploring an ancient civilization's planet. The player assumes the role of Master Chief who battles against a new faction that splintered off from remnants of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(Halo)">Covenant</a>, a former military alliance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life_in_fiction">alien</a> races, as well as a new enemy: mechanical warriors of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factions_of_Halo#Forerunner">Forerunner</a> empire known as the Prometheans. The game features a new selection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons">weapons</a>, enemies, and game modes not present in previous titles of the series.</p>

<p>Development of <i>Halo 4</i> began in 2009 and continued until September 2012. <i>Halo 4</i> is 343 Industries' first original title within the <i>Halo</i> series—previously, development of the main series was undertaken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">Bungie</a>, the creator of the franchise. In the developmental process, 343 Industries decided to explore the Forerunner fiction within the <i>Halo</i> universe, leading the team to design a new setting, enemies, and main antagonist. Existing characters and assets received visual overhauls, recreated from the ground up, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture">motion capture</a> was used for animation within cutscenes. A goal for <i>Halo 4</i>'s story was to incorporate more human elements; to achieve this, the developers chose to delve more deeply into the relationship between the two protagonists, Master Chief and Cortana. Several external studios assisted 343 Industries with developing <i>Halo 4</i>, and over 350 people worked on the game in total.</p>

<p>The game was officially announced at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo_2011">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011</a> (E3) on June 6. Prior to launch, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> stated that <i>Halo 4</i> was the most expensive video game title the company had created so far. The game was marketed with promotional events and videos, including the creation of a live-action film, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_4:_Forward_Unto_Dawn">Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn</a></i>. <i>Halo 4</i> grossed US$220 million on its launch day and $300 million in its opening week—a record for the franchise. More than one million people played <i>Halo 4</i> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live">Xbox Live</a> within the first 24 hours of its release. The game was met with positive reviews by professional critics and received multiple nominations and awards from the press. It was re-released as part of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_The_Master_Chief_Collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a></i> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One">Xbox One</a> in 2014, and for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a> in 2020. It was followed by a sequel, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_5:_Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></i>, in 2015 for Xbox One.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p><i>Halo 4</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooter_game">shooter game</a> in which players predominantly experience gameplay from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person</a> perspective; the game perspective switches to third-person when using certain weapons, abilities and vehicles. The player's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display">head-up display</a> (HUD) shows real-time information on the player character's armor system, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_(gaming)">shield</a> status, information on current weapons and abilities, and waypoints for goals and objectives. The HUD also has a motion tracker that detects allies, enemies, and vehicles within a certain radius of the player. The game sees the return of the alien species who were formerly members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_(Halo)">Covenant</a> as foes, and introduces a new type of enemy called the Prometheans, which are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forerunners_(Halo)">Forerunner</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) constructs. There are three types of Prometheans: Knights serve as leaders of the group and are considered the deadliest of the Promethean forces; Crawlers are a weaker class that often attack in packs; and Watchers offer support and have the ability to shield or revive Promethean allies.</p>

<p><i>Halo 4</i> features updated versions of many human and Covenant weaponry from previous <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(series)">Halo</a></i> games, as well as introducing new weapons for the humans, Covenant and Prometheans. The game also features reusable equipment, called armor abilities, introduced in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Reach">Halo: Reach</a></i>. New armor abilities are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentry_gun">autosentry</a>; the hardlight shield, which activates a protective barrier similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_shield">riot shield</a>; Promethean vision, which diminishes environment detail and shows hidden players as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette">silhouettes</a>; a regeneration field, which heals all players in close proximity and can emit a short range kinetic blast; and finally the thruster pack, which allows the player to launch themselves several feet in a horizontal direction. Returning abilities include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_camouflage">active camouflage</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_pack">jetpack</a>; and hologram, which creates a doppelgänger of the player running towards a target point. Sprinting returns in <i>Halo 4</i>; however, players can now use it independently of their armor ability. New gameplay mechanics introduced to the series include throwing and catching, which has been implemented into the multiplayer game modes Oddball and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_Teeth_Productions#Grifball">Grifball</a>.</p>

<h3>Modes</h3>

<p><i>Halo 4</i>'s story or campaign mode can be played alone or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_video_game">cooperatively</a> with one other player on the same console via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_screen_(computer_graphics)">split screen</a>, and up to three other players through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live">Xbox Live</a>. Unlike in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3">Halo 3</a></i> cooperative campaign where each player takes the role of a different character, in <i>Halo 4</i> all players assume the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Chief_(Halo)">Master Chief</a>. Players can enable "skulls" in the campaign menu which act as gameplay modifiers such as increasing enemy health, changing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character">NPC</a> behavior or removing elements of the player's HUD. The campaign also features terminals which provide the player with additional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory">backstory</a> via videos viewed in the <i>Halo Waypoint</i> application on the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>In <i>Halo 4</i>'s multiplayer component, titled "Infinity", players assume the role of a customizable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Halo#Spartans">Spartan-IV super-soldier</a>. Players can progress through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levels_up">ranks</a> by earning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point">experience points</a> from completing matches and challenges. Gameplay items such as visual customizations, weapons, armor abilities, and various upgrades are unlocked and can be acquired by players when they gain ranks. Once players attain rank SR-50, they can enlist into a "Specialization", enabling them to unlock further cosmetic and gameplay-enhancing customizations for their Spartan. War Games is a competitive multiplayer matchmaking mode. There are various playlists with different game types ranging from standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathmatch_(video_games)">deathmatch</a> to objective oriented modes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(video_games)">capture the flag</a>. War Games can be played with up to sixteen players on Xbox Live and has up to four-player split screen support. In <i>Halo 4</i>, players are able to join certain multiplayer matchmaking sessions while they are in progress. Spartan Ops is a story-driven episodic game mode, that can be played solo or cooperatively like the campaign mode. It serves as a replacement for the Firefight game mode that featured in <i>Halo: Reach</i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3:_ODST">Halo 3: ODST</a></i>. Ten episodes of content were released for Spartan Ops, each featured a cinematic and five objective-based missions. The first five episodes were delivered on a weekly basis following <i>Halo 4</i>'s launch, the final five episodes were released in early 2013.</p>

<p>Other game features include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_(level_editor)">Forge</a>, a map-editing tool first introduced in <i>Halo 3</i>. Like War Games it has both split screen and Xbox Live support. Using the tool, players can edit default multiplayer maps by adding or modifying spawn points, weapons and items, or create new ones using canvases. Forge in <i>Halo 4</i> contains a new "magnet" feature for connecting forge pieces together. Theater mode allows players to view films, create video clips, and capture screen shots from recent matches in War Games or custom games. <i>Halo 4</i> also offers a file sharing system that allows players to upload and share video clips, screenshots, custom maps and game variants.</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<h3>Setting and characters</h3>

<p><i>Halo 4</i> takes place in a futuristic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a> setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of <i>Halo 3</i>. Backstory details that hundreds of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_(Halo)">Flood</a>, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other strategic option available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_Array">Halo Array</a>. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.</p>

<p>In the 26th century, humanity came under attack by the Covenant, an alien collective of species that worship the Forerunners as gods. The human supersoldier Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 and his artificial intelligence companion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(Halo)">Cortana</a>, were instrumental in stopping the Halos from being activated, sterilizing the Flood outbreak before they could menace the galaxy once again, and defeating the Covenant resulting in the end of the war. At the end of <i>Halo 3</i>, Chief and Cortana were left stranded in unknown space aboard the remains of the vessel <i>Forward Unto Dawn</i>.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>In October 2007, shortly after the release of <i>Halo 3</i>, <i>Halo</i> developer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">Bungie</a> split off from parent company Microsoft. Microsoft retained the intellectual property and rights to <i>Halo</i>, and Bungie continued developing <i>Halo</i> games until 2010. During this period of time Microsoft formed an internal division, 343 Industries, to manage the franchise and develop future games.</p>

<p>In 2008, while 343 Industries was still in formation, Microsoft approached Starlight Runner Entertainment to help assemble the "<i>Halo</i> bible". Starlight Runner is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</a>-based company that specializes in creating and producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling">transmedia</a> franchises. Their job was to examine all content of the <i>Halo</i> universe, clean it up, and make it coherent and understandable for the people involved with the creation of <i>Halo</i> games and media. Frank O'Connor, a content manager at Bungie, assisted the team with the creation of the "<i>Halo</i> bible" before moving to 343 Industries to become <i>Halo</i> franchise development director. Unlike the original trilogy, the story for <i>Halo 4</i> was designed to be part of a multi-game arc from the beginning. Christopher Schlerf and Holmes wrote the script and story. In addition, 343 Industries aimed for "a more complete connectivity between all of their future media than before"; relating <i>Halo 4</i>'s story to the <i>Forerunner Saga</i> and <i>Kilo-Five Trilogy</i> novels as well as using terminals in <i>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</i> to introduce background knowledge on the Forerunners.</p>

<p>343 started with a staff of roughly a dozen people, but grew to nearly 200 through development. <i>Halo 4</i>'s development team included former employees of more than 25 triple-A studios. Prospective employees could not be told they were going to be working on <i>Halo 4</i>. "We had people who we hired who hated <i>Halo</i> because of 'X,'" said Frank O'Connor, 343 Industries' franchise development director. "But what that really meant was, 'I feel like this game could be awesome because of 'Y input' that I'm going to bring into it. I want to prove it, and I'm passionate about proving it.' So we ended up with a bunch of people who were genuinely passionate about the product. That is a huge advantage, and that helped in hiring and forming our team." This rapid hiring and growth occurred during development of the game, creating issues; because the team was committed to a delivery date, <i>Halo 4</i> executive producer Kiki Wolfkill said that the team was forced to make "necessary mistakes", with production difficulties and a team inexperienced with working together contributing to development difficulties. Nine months before shipping, the developers restructured the game's production pipeline and gave individual teams more control due to bottlenecks in development. With so many developers from different backgrounds, forging a common goal and company culture was different. Creative director Josh Holmes recalled that an "epiphany moment" that proved the team was headed in the right direction was early in development, when the team completed a section of the game that was "very traditional [<i>Halo</i>]". Despite positive feedback from testers, 343 Industries discarded the prototype as too traditional, but felt that it showed the team could work together.</p>

<p>Including contractors, 350 people worked on the game. 343 Industries contracted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certain_Affinity">Certain Affinity</a>, an independent video game development studio, to help with the development of <i>Halo 4</i>; they started work on the game in early 2011. Certain Affinity has worked alongside Bungie and 343 Industries on producing multiplayer content for previous <i>Halo</i> titles. The studio developed the Forge mode, co-developed War Games and created a number of maps and multiplayer modes for <i>Halo 4</i>.</p>

<p><i>Halo 4</i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved_Anniversary">Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</a></i> were both officially announced on June 6, 2011, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2011">E3 2011</a>. <i>Halo 4</i> is the first installment in the Reclaimer Saga of <i>Halo</i> games. The studio's creative team, which included nearly 200 people led by creative director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Holmes_(video_game_designer)">Josh Holmes</a>, started developing the game as early as 2009. Prior to the release of the game, Microsoft Studios Vice President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spencer_(Microsoft)">Phil Spencer</a> stated that the <i>Halo</i> franchise is the "most important entertainment product in the company" and that <i>Halo 4</i> was the most expensive game that Microsoft had made. A demonstration of the game's campaign was first shown at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3_2012">E3 2012</a>. The developers described it as a pivotal moment in development, as it was the first time the game had been shown publicly. The positive reaction was a morale boost for the team, who were unsure how the public would react. On July 7, 2012, a pre-release build of <i>Halo 4</i>'s Forge mode was showcased by 343 Industries and Certain Affinity at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooster_Teeth_Productions#RTX">RTX</a> which took place at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Convention_Center">Austin Convention Center</a>. On September 26, 2012, O'Connor announced that the game's development was complete.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>Following <i>Halo 4</i>'s announcement, O'Connor reported that both Master Chief and Cortana would undergo "radical" changes in appearance for the game, some of them attributed to better graphics and others to story elements. The studio wanted Master Chief's appearance to convey an imposing mass and weight, to show that one of his characteristics is his 800-pound (360 kg) armor. They studied the armor changes that were made for the Spartans in <i>Halo: Reach</i>, which were much bulkier than renditions in previous <i>Halo</i> games. Character and concept artists began redesigning the Master Chief by creating sketches; these sketches would be rendered into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling">3D models</a> so the team could analyze the design from every possible angle. The team would then return to creating sketches to make adjustments, and repeat the process until the main structure for the Master Chief was created. The team then worked on the finer details of his appearance.</p>

<p>During the concepting process of <i>Halo 4</i>, O'Connor decided it would be best for the franchise to explore the Forerunner fiction of the <i>Halo</i> universe, which had remained largely a mystery before 343 Industries' involvement in the franchise. This ultimately led to the creation of a new race of enemy, the Prometheans, warriors of the Forerunner empire. Given that the Forerunners themselves had never been featured in previous <i>Halo</i> games, the design process for the appearance of the Prometheans was long and tedious. The art team produced a large number of sketches, which were presented to other members of the studio to get feedback and reactions. Many variations of different character models were considered before the team decided on a final design. The main goal when designing their appearance was to make them resonate with the player, and evoke the image of the Forerunner architecture and language that had been portrayed in previous <i>Halo</i> media. Upon death, the Promethean Knight dissolves from the point where it was last shot; this visual effect also occurs when certain enemies are killed by Promethean weapons. From a gameplay standpoint the design for the Prometheans also needed to fit in well with the sandbox so they would be suitable enemies to fight. A goal when designing their behavior was to make them highly adaptive from a tactical standpoint. For example, the Promethean Knight can phase in and out of space, allowing it to retreat or charge the player at any given moment; this changes the way that a player engages in a combat encounter.</p>

<p>Holmes explained that one of the goals for <i>Halo 4</i>'s campaign was to incorporate more human elements into the story. To accomplish this the team wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subplot">B story</a> that explored Master Chief's relationship with his AI partner, Cortana, who would break down into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia">dementia</a>-like state. The development team realized that <i>Halo 4</i>'s narrative could be dense and hard to approach, making it inaccessible for new players. They found incorporating such a storyline into an action game to be extremely challenging and considered dropping it during development. Holmes was adamant about including it; he took inspiration from his mother's battle with dementia, which she was diagnosed with near the start of the game's development. This led Holmes to want to capture the emotion and tell "a perfect story".</p>

<p>The senior art director for <i>Halo 4</i> is Kenneth Scott; he described the visual style of <i>Halo 4</i> as being more ingrained in the expanded universe fiction, and more "mature" than before. With the game's increased focus on the Forerunners, the artists invested heavily into the look and feel of Forerunner technology. The game also features more diversity in Forerunner structures, including fully active Forerunner technology as opposed to the mostly inert and abandoned structures seen in the earlier games. The majority of the game is lit statically using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightmap">lightmaps</a>; this allowed the art team to achieve realistic lighting effects with full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination">global illumination</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion">ambient occlusion</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting">Image-based lighting</a> is also used to ground scenes and make everything fit together better.</p>

<p>The cooperative Spartan Ops mode originally began as a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in <i>Halo: Reach</i>, but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a narrative that would tie <i>Halo 4</i>'s multiplayer together. The missions were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode such that the cinematics would tie in with the missions.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow">Glasgow</a> based animation studio, Axis Animation, assisted 343 Industries on the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery">CGI</a> cinematics for the Spartan Ops game mode. Axis have produced animations for numerous video games, including the award-winning announcement trailer for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Island">Dead Island</a></i>. To make each Spartan Ops episode as engaging as possible the team at Axis shot and edited episodes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action">live action</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_capture">performance capture</a>. The team then used the reference cameras at the live action shoot to create a performance edit, before shooting with CG cameras to provide more coverage of all scenes and a greater selection of shots for the editorial team. The shading team at Axis made use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation">3D animation</a> package, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houdini_(software)">Houdini</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation">procedurally generate</a> the environment in the cinematics. Axis worked with Glasgow-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_post_production">audio post production</a> company Savalas on sound design and the final mix for the Spartan Ops cinematics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_motion_capture">Facial motion capture</a> was also utilized to take the movements and facial expressions from actors and apply them to the in-game cinematics for both Spartan Ops and campaign. Performance capture for both campaign and Spartan Ops cutscenes was directed and recorded at Giant Studios. Axis worked in conjunction with Giant Studios and Cubic Motion to develop a special facial motion capture solution that would retain facial expressions from the actors when creating the animation.</p>

<p>Visual effects house The Sequence Group, who had previously developed animation for <i>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</i>'s terminals, returned to create additional animation for <i>Halo 4</i>. The Terminals feature a painterly artistic style, which Sequence president Ian Kirby felt appealed to gamers familiar with the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_art">concept art</a>. In addition to creating the visuals for the <i>Halo 4</i> terminals, their work appeared in one of the game's main cinematics. To save time and expense using traditional motion capture methods to animate the 3D characters, The Sequence Group used twin Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a> infrared sensors to create a home-made solution.</p>

<p>The game utilizes much of the "sandbox" that has been featured across all six prior <i>Halo</i> games and other media, in addition to introducing new characters, weapons, vehicles, and other elements. The game engine used is a heavily modified version of the engine established by Bungie. Unlike previous games in the <i>Halo</i> series, <i>Halo 4</i> runs natively in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p">720p</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution">resolution</a>. The game itself comes on two discs and requires 4GB of available storage space either on an 8GB <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive">USB flash drive</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_hardware#Hard_drive_storage">Xbox 360 hard drive</a> to play the multiplayer component. Disc two is used to install the multiplayer content and disc one is used for launching the game. Due to rendering issues and significant engine changes, Theater support for <i>Halo 4</i>'s campaign and Spartan Ops was not featured in the game on launch; however 343 Industries expressed that this feature may be implemented in the future.</p>

<p>As with previous <i>Halo</i> titles, 343 Industries provides a statistic tracking service for players of <i>Halo 4</i>. Player data such as game history, character progression, and various statistics can be accessed in game or via the Halo Waypoint website. The web services team at 343 Industries utilized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Azure">Windows Azure Service Bus</a> messaging infrastructure to relay data from the Xbox Live network to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-end_database">back-end databases</a>, where player data and information is stored. <i>Halo 4</i> player data can also be accessed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_SmartGlass">Xbox SmartGlass</a> application.</p>

<p>British record producer and composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Davidge">Neil Davidge</a> wrote the music for <i>Halo 4</i>. Davidge is best known for his work as a co-writer and producer for the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_Attack">Massive Attack</a>, and also composed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score">scores</a> for numerous films. Davidge intended to add "a touch of romance" to the score as well as adding more electronic sounds while keeping <i>Halo</i>'s style.</p>

<p>Sotaro Tojima, best known for his work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami">Konami</a>'s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Circle_of_the_Moon">Castlevania: Circle of the Moon</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_4:_Guns_of_the_Patriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></i>, served as <i>Halo 4</i>'s audio director. The team performed many live audio recording sessions, several of which occurred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, Australia. Some of these recording sessions took place in generally inhospitable environments, such as underwater, in fire, and in ice, through the use of specially designed microphones; other recording sessions have utilized "home made" explosives. Tojima intended for the game's audio to be clearly grounded in the <i>Halo</i> universe, while also having a more realistic quality than in past titles.</p>

<p>Music composer Kazuma Jinnouchi, also formerly from Konami, joined 343 Industries during the production of <i>Halo 4</i> in 2011. He contributed several additional tracks for the game. He would later go on to be the sole composer of the game's sequel, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_5:_Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></i>, in 2015.</p>

<p>Voice actors returning to reprise their roles in <i>Halo 4</i> include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Downes">Steve Downes</a> as Master Chief, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_Taylor">Jen Taylor</a> as both Cortana and Halsey.

For the remaining players, the Specializations were gradually unlocked in the months following launch.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> produced an Xbox 360 Limited Edition <i>Halo 4</i> console bundle that launched alongside the game. The bundle features two custom designed controllers, a standard edition of <i>Halo 4</i>, a wired headset, exclusive downloadable content and a <i>Halo 4</i>-themed Xbox 360 containing a 320GB hard drive.

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical reception</h3>

<p><i>Halo 4</i> received mostly positive reviews from critics, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator">aggregate review</a> website <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic">Metacritic</a> assigning it an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)">average</a> score of 87 out of 100, based on 87 reviews. Many reviewers were impressed by 343 Industries' debut effort and considered it a worthy addition to the series. Ryan McCaffrey of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN">IGN</a> gave <i>Halo 4</i> a very positive review, considering it to be the best game of the series to date and the best Xbox 360 game of 2012; he called it "a bar-raising triumph for the entire first-person shooter genre." Wesley Yin-Poole of <i>Eurogamer</i> remarked that although he was initially skeptical of changes being made to the formula, 343's greatest achievement was managing to stay true to what <i>Halo</i> is. He was enthusiastic to see what the developer would do with <i>Halo 5</i> and expected them to deviate further while retaining the series' "magic".</p>

<p><i>Halo 4</i>'s campaign received widespread acclaim reception from critics. Reviewers enjoyed Master Chief's return as the protagonist, and the emotional connection between Master Chief and Cortana was highly praised. Mike Mahardy of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer">Game Informer</a></i> complimented the characterization improvements of Chief and Cortana, calling their evolved love story more "focused" and "relatable" to the player, in comparison to the "cloudy and impersonal" stories from the prior games of the franchise. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot">GameSpot</a> editor, Chris Watters, described the "thrilling and emotional return of Master Chief and Cortana" as the highlight of the game. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> maintained that the narrative was enthralling and the campaign's structure was much better than its predecessors. IGN's McCaffrey praised the game's lighting, movements, animations, and lauded the campaign for its pacing, "deftly mixing on-foot combat, vehicle sequences, quiet story moments, and key Chief-and-Cortana interactions." Although Neil Davidge's work on the musical composition was noted as a "bold shift", McCaffrey claimed the music seemed "complementary rather than additive."</p>

<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1UP.com">1UP.com</a></i> reviewer Jose Otero was critical of <i>Halo 4</i>'s story, writing that the ending of the game "doesn't make a lot of sense". He also remarked that while the narrative tied the main plot lines together well, it was disappointing to see some of the smaller story points were ignored entirely. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4_(U.S._TV_channel)">G4</a> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Xbox_Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a></i> agreed that the plot became convoluted on occasions and might be difficult to understand for new players of the franchise. G4 reviewer, Adam Rosenburg, also stated that while the soundtrack had some memorable moments, he was disappointed that composer Neil Davidge had chosen to ditch the familiar theme of previous games. Michael Gapper of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_Video_Games">Computer and Video Games</a></i> drew a comparison between <i>Halo 4</i> and <i>Halo 2</i>. He stated that the hardware limitations of the Xbox 360 had negatively impacted <i>Halo 4</i>'s campaign, in the same way that they had throttled Bungie's ambitions for <i>Halo 2</i> on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)">Xbox</a>. He explained that although the game was visually stunning, this had detracted from the scale and spectacle that was present in <i>Halo 3</i>'s campaign. He found the spaces within the campaign to be narrow and constrained which led to a lack of tactical options in encounters.</p>

<p>Competitive multiplayer received positive reception by critics. Chris Watters of GameSpot welcomed the new armor abilities and gameplay tweaks introduced in multiplayer. He praised the continuing robustness of Custom Game options and the accessibility of level editing in Forge. CVG's Gapper stated that the new scoring system alone made <i>Halo 4</i> multiplayer the best in the series, emphasizing that recognition for assists and completing objective tasks was a positive change. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)">Polygon</a></i> writer, Arthur Gies, said that the new game mode Dominion was the best addition to <i>Halo</i> multiplayer since the introduction of Xbox Live. He also thought that the multiplayer component was more approachable to people outside of the core player-base without dumbing anything down.</p>

<p>Reception towards Spartan Ops was mixed to positive; some reviewers expressed their disappointment in Spartan Ops replacing the cooperative Firefight mode. Criticisms were aimed at the brevity of missions and lack of replay value. Despite any shortcomings, IGN said the mode was a must-play for the "incredible pre-episode cinematics" which open up "a number of interesting narrative possibilities for future episodes and seasons." Martin Robinson of Eurogamer complained about the repetition of environments within the first half of the season and noted that missions quickly become a chore. He felt that Spartan Ops was a "weak, bloated alternative" compared to Firefight. <i>1UP.com</i> found that while the short length felt odd initially, the mode was still fun to play and offered more opportunities to play <i>Halo</i> cooperatively.</p>
