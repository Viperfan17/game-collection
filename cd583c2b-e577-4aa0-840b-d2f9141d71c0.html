The game is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D">2.5D</a>: movement is restricted to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics">two-dimensional</a> plane, while the characters and backgrounds are rendered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics">three-dimensions</a>. Unlike the traditional fighting game design involving multiple rounds with regenerative life bars, <i>Injustice</i> uses a scheme similar to the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Instinct_(video_game_series)">Killer Instinct</a></i> series. Each match consists of a single round with each player bearing two life bars. The game utilizes a four-button control layout of light, medium, and heavy attacks, alongside a "character trait" button, which activates a unique ability or attack designed to showcase each character. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Superman</a>'s character trait provides a temporary boost in strength, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a>'s character trait summons a swarm of robotic bats.</p>

<p>The stages, based on various locations from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe">DC Universe</a>, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcave">Batcave</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)">Metropolis</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a>, feature interactive environments and multiple areas. If an opponent is hit with a heavy attack near a corner of the arena, it launches them, triggering a transition animation and taking the fight to a new section of the stage. Each section also contains objects that characters can interact with differently depending on their class. Characters fall into two classes: "power characters", who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and "gadget characters", who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win. For example, a gadget character like Batman can attach a bomb to a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman will pick up the same car and smash his opponents with it. Players have the option to turn off interactive elements and stage transitions.</p>

<p>As characters perform special moves, block oncoming attacks, or get hit by the opponent, their "super meters" will gradually fill. Portions of the super meter can be used to execute enhanced special moves or counter enemy moves. With a full meter, players can unleash their strongest special attack. Players may also expend their meter to interrupt a combo and enter a wager battle, dubbed the "clash system", which combines individualized cutscene cinematics with the process of betting meter. A clash may be triggered by a player only after they have lost their first life bar. During the sequence, both players commit portions of their meter in secret, with the highest bidder winning the clash.</p>

<p>The story mode is split into several chapters. As the narrative plays out, the player swaps between different characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigame">Minigames</a> are also incorporated into the story. The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over the CPU opponent. Additional game features include Battle Mode, Versus Mode, Training Mode, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.R._Labs">S.T.A.R. Labs</a>, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and Survivor, which carries over the current winner's health bar and character selection over each match. Playing through any of the game modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points that may be used to unlock alternate costumes, music, concept art, and other rewards.</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p>The campaign of <i>Injustice: Gods Among Us</i> was written by NetherRealm Studios in collaboration with DC Comics' writers. Described by NetherRealm as "Story Mode 3.0", the <i>Injustice</i> campaign was approached similarly to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_vs._DC_Universe">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</a></i> and the 2011 <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_(2011_video_game)">Mortal Kombat</a></i> reboot through the use of a cinematic narrative versus the traditional ladder-based single-player experience. According to lead designer John Edwards, the plot is meant to rationalize the game's fighting mechanics between characters that would not normally fight one another and explain how Batman can "stand toe-to-toe" with Superman. Writers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gray">Justin Gray</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Palmiotti">Jimmy Palmiotti</a> served as story consultants to ensure that the comic characters kept their proper voices in <i>Injustice</i>.</p>

<h3>Plot</h3>

<p>In a parallel universe (known as Earth-49), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(character)">Joker</a> tricks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Superman</a> into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us_(comics)">killing</a> his pregnant wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Lane">Lois Lane</a> and detonating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon">nuclear weapon</a> that destroys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)">Metropolis</a>, killing millions. Mad with grief and rage, Superman murders the Joker, quickly losing his moral compass.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe">the prime DC universe</a>, the Joker also attempts to destroy Metropolis with a nuke supplied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Luthor">Lex Luthor</a>, but the villains are foiled by the Justice League. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a> confronts the Joker, the two are suddenly teleported into the parallel universe, where they find themselves pursued by One Earth Regime forces. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Arrow">Green Arrow</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Jordan">Green Lantern</a> are also teleported there. The latter leaves to recharge his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ring_(DC_Comics)">power ring</a> and rescues a captive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a>, while having altercations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_(DC_Comics)">Cyborg</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_(DC_Comics)">Raven</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinestro">Sinestro</a>, and his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinestro_Corps">Yellow Lantern</a> counterpart, all members of the Regime. Meanwhile, Aquaman finds that in the five years after Superman killed the Joker, Superman has formed the One Earth Regime to enforce global peace through fear, and rules the Earth with an iron fist as a ruthless dictator, alongside many other heroes and villains, and killing any who oppose him. The parallel Batman established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency">Insurgency</a> to oppose Superman's Regime, and the ensuing war between the two factions left the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League">Justice League</a> disbanded. Aquaman fights his counterpart in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis_(Aquaman)">Atlantis</a>, who is negotiating an alliance between Atlantis and the Regime, and encounters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_(DC_Comics)">Ares</a>, who is weak from the virtual lack of conflict and has allied with the Insurgency out of spite for the Regime.</p>

<p>Regrouping, the prime heroes meet Insurgency Batman and Lex Luthor (who in this universe is Superman's closest friend and an Insurgency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(espionage)">mole</a>) and receive nanotech pills derived from Kryptonian DNA, which increase their strength to Superman's level. Insurgency Batman and Luthor explain to the heroes that they teleported them into their universe to help access a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptonite">kryptonite</a> weapon, which requires a DNA sample of all core Justice League members; however, the prime Batman and prime Joker were teleported by accident. Elsewhere, Batman is mistaken for his Insurgency counterpart and captured by the Regime, while the Joker meets this universe's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn">Harley Quinn</a>, who is allied with the Insurgency and founded the "Joker Clan" in his memory. After helping the Joker Clan fight off a Regime attack at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkham_Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>, the Insurgents infiltrate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcave">Batcave</a> and retrieve the kryptonite weapon. Meanwhile, in the prime universe, Superman and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)">Flash</a>'s efforts to recover their comrades result in Cyborg being inadvertently teleported into the Regime's universe, where he joins the Insurgency and helps Deathstroke take over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_Watchtower">Regime Watchtower</a>.</p>

<p>After Regime Superman publicly announces his intentions to execute prime Batman, Insurgency Batman and Green Arrow break into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryker's_Island">Stryker's Island</a> to rescue him, while Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman stage an attack on the Regime to distract them. After the Batmen and Green Arrow escape via the Watchtower's teleporter, Regime Superman realizes the Watchtower has been compromised and attempts to destroy it, but Deathstroke causes a chain explosion that sends him plummeting back to Earth. Luthor attempts to incapacitate the weakened Superman with the kryptonite weapon but is stopped by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Marvel_(DC_Comics)">Shazam</a>, allowing Regime Superman to kill him and destroy the weapon. Now aware of humanity's determination to depose him, Regime Superman decides to destroy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City">Gotham City</a> and Metropolis to keep Earth’s population in line, as well as invade the prime heroes' universe for their interference. When Shazam protests and invokes Lois' memory,  Regime Superman murders him, causing Regime Flash to defect to the Insurgency.</p>

<p>During a Regime attack on the Insurgency's hideout, Wonder Woman is teleported by Ares to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themyscira_(DC_Comics)">Themyscira</a>, where she defeats her Regime counterpart and convinces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons_(DC_Comics)">Amazons</a> to defect to the Insurgency. Meanwhile, prime Batman convinces his counterpart to bring prime Superman over to help. During the ensuing battle, prime Superman overpowers the Regime's top lieutenants and persuades Yellow Lantern to surrender, before confronting his counterpart at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a>, pitying his loss yet declaring the planet needs freedom. When Regime Superman vows to bring prime Lois over, his prime counterpart reminds him Lois would be horrified at the tyrant he has become.</p>

<p>Following Regime Superman's defeat, the Regime is dissolved, and its members imprisoned; Regime Flash is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole">paroled</a>, while Yellow Lantern is taken to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oa_(comics)">Oa</a> to be rehabilitated. The prime heroes and Joker return to their universe but not before Insurgency Batman and prime Superman oversee the imprisonment of the latter's counterpart within a cell emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless. When Superman admits that he could also go down a dark path if a similar tragedy happened to him, Insurgency Batman assures that he will stand up to him if so. Superman merely chuckles and tells him to get in line. As they walk away, Regime Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers left.</p>

<h2>Characters</h2>

<p>The roster was selected internally by NetherRealm Studios with input from DC Comics. The main goal during the selection process, which took around three to four months, was to create a cast featuring a wide variety of characters. Characters were chosen based on criteria such as size, ability, gender, popularity, and how well they fit within the <i>Injustice</i> storyline. The addition of each playable hero and villain required about six weeks of development. The characters were designed with the intent to make each fighter unique, and fighting styles and movesets were tailored to the lore and personality of each character. Ed Boon stated that DC Comics had given NetherRealm a large amount of freedom with their properties, allowing them to put their own spin on characters. Several other characters from the DC Universe, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarecrow_(DC_Comics)">Scarecrow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallo">Metallo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla_Grodd">Gorilla Grodd</a>, also appear as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_characters">non-player characters</a>, making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearances">cameo appearances</a> in story cutscenes, stages and other game modes. Outside of the DC universe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion_(Mortal_Kombat)">Scorpion</a> from NetherRealm's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat">Mortal Kombat</a></i> series appears as a downloadable guest character.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p><i>Injustice: Gods Among Us</i> was first announced on May 31, 2012. According to Ed Boon, the main goal heading into <i>Injustice</i> was to create a game outside of the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> series that was dramatically different within the fighting game genre. Producer Hector Sanchez stated that NetherRealm Studios did not feel constrained by the parameters of <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, allowing the developers to take more design risks with <i>Injustice</i>, such as removing <i>Mortal Kombat</i>'s traditional dedicated block button. Similar to Boon's previous DC-related title, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_vs._DC_Universe">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</a></i> (2008), the use of the DC Comics license implied restrictions to the amount of violence in the game; however, Boon intended to push the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board#Ratings">"Teen" rating</a> by replacing violence with "crazy, over-the-top action." When questioned if the studio's past experience with <i>Mortal Kombat</i> and its characteristic violence would influence <i>Injustice</i>, Boon replied that he wanted to keep the two titles as separate entities.</p>

<p>The online mode in <i>Injustice</i> was built upon the foundation laid from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_(2011_video_game)">Mortal Kombat</a></i> (2011). Due to complaints about severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lag_(online_gaming)">lag</a> in the online multiplayer portion of <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, Boon reported that the development team had looked back upon their past mistakes and created a "new, more elaborate system" for an improved online experience. Senior Producer Adam Urbano stated NetherRealm Studios spent two years of development focusing on netplay. During development, NetherRealm shared their idea for an automated system to push <i>Injustice</i> downloadable content to all users' consoles. The game would connect to the Internet during use and automatically download the information required for players who have bought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content">DLC</a> characters to play against others who have not. The system also allows NetherRealm to quickly send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix">hotfixes</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)">patch</a> noticeable glitches.</p>

<p>Like <i>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</i> and <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, <i>Injustice</i> runs on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine_3">Unreal Engine 3</a>, which was modified to suit fighting games. In the first <i>Injustice</i> development diary, NetherRealm Studios proclaimed that several technical advancements had been made since the release of <i>Mortal Kombat</i> in 2011. Sanchez stated that their "KoreTech team" had pushed the boundaries on their graphics engine. Urbano added that the game features a revamped lighting solution, enabling more dynamic lighting in terms of characters and environments. A new "character material" system was created to portray characters with increased graphical detail. <i>Injustice</i> also utilizes a multi-threaded rendering engine, allowing the game to display approximately three times the amount of objects on screen at a single time than <i>Mortal Kombat</i>.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>Prior to the game's release, Warner Bros. Interactive and DC Entertainment launched a 10-week-long online marketing campaign called the <i>Injustice Battle Arena</i>. The web series, hosted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taryn_Southern">Taryn Southern</a>, featured weekly match-ups between the playable cast in a tournament-style format. Each week, the arena was updated with different versus scenarios. Fans could vote for their favorite characters, and a video, depicting the winner of each round, would be released following each voting period. Videos detailing the skills and strengths of the combatants, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_pop">vox pop</a> and celebrity interviews, were released alongside each new pair of challengers. Voters could redeem free rewards, ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(Xbox_Live)">Xbox Live avatar</a> accessories to a downloadable character skin based on Green Arrow's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Queen_(Arrowverse)">appearance</a> in the television series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(TV_series)">Arrow</a></i>. Participating fans based in the United States were also eligible to win weekly prizes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo">demo</a> version of the game was released as a download for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on April 2, 2013, in North America, and April 3, 2013, in Europe. The demo showcased Batman, Wonder Woman, and Lex Luthor, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City">Gotham City</a> stage, with Doomsday as an unplayable boss.</p>

<h2>Release</h2>

<p><i>Injustice: Gods Among Us</i> was released on April 16, 2013, in North America, April 17 in Australia, and April 19 in Europe for the PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360. Certain Australian retailers, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JB_Hi-Fi">JB Hi-Fi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EB_Games">EB Games</a>, broke the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_date">street date</a>, selling copies on April 15, 2013. The release of the Wii U version of <i>Injustice</i> was delayed in the United Kingdom until April 26, 2013. The game was released later in Japan on June 9, 2013, for the PlayStation 3 and Wii U.
