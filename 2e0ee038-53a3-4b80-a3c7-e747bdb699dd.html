					<p><i><b>Kinect Sports</b></i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_video_game">sports video game</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)">Rare</a> and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Studios">Microsoft Game Studios</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a>. The game utilizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a> motion-sensing peripheral and was released in North America on 4 November 2010 as a launch title for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a>, then, a few days later, in Europe and Australia.</p>

<p>The game is a collection of six sports simulations and eight mini-games, designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of Kinect. The six sports included are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling">ten-pin bowling</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing">boxing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field">track and field</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis">table tennis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_volleyball">beach volleyball</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">association football</a> ("soccer" in North America). Standing in front of the Kinect sensor, players compete by mimicking actions performed in real-life sports, such as throwing a javelin or kicking a football.</p>

<p>The game received generally positive reviews from critics and sold over three million units as of April 2011. A sequel to the game, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect_Sports:_Season_Two">Kinect Sports: Season Two</a></i>, developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_(company)">Rare</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigPark">BigPark</a>, was released in October 2011. Along with its sequel, <i>Kinect Sports</i> has been released in the <i>Kinect Sports Ultimate Collection</i> bundle on 18 September 2012, with additional bonus content and extra sports in <i>Season Two</i> added, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf">golf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing">skiing</a>. A third entry, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect_Sports_Rivals">Kinect Sports Rivals</a></i>, was released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One">Xbox One</a> in 2014.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>All six of the events in <i>Kinect Sports</i> support multiplayer both locally and online, with a mixture of competitive and cooperative play options. In addition, players can also take part in eight sport-based mini games, or join in the Party Play mode designed to accommodate a larger number of players amassed in the same room, divided into two teams.</p>

<p>Players are represented in-game by their Xbox 360 avatar. Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a> sensor, the player's physical gestures and body movements are tracked and translated into in-game actions without the need for a controller.</p>

<p>At the end of each event, players are shown a video compilation of their 'best bits' captured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect">Kinect</a> sensor. Clips can be uploaded to the KinectShare website where they can be downloaded, deleted or shared directly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>.</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling">Bowling</a> takes place at Neon Lanes. Players are required to reach to their left or right to take up a ball before swinging their arm forwards to bowl, exaggerating the arm motion to add spin if required. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. Bowling mini games include One Bowl Roll, in which the player must clear as many pin setups as possible before running out of chances, and Pin Rush, where the player is challenged to knock over as many pins as possible within a time limit.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing">Boxing</a> takes place at Tornado Gardens. Players are encouraged to use their left and right arms to punch and block, both at head and body height. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. It is the only sport without any mini games.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_&amp;_Field">Track &amp; Field</a> is a collection of five separate events, all of which take place at Flame Stadium. The events are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)">Sprint</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin">Javelin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Jump">Long Jump</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discus">Discus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdles">Hurdles</a>. Each event can be played individually (within the Mini Games area) or collectively as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentathlon">pentathlon</a>. Players must jog on the spot to run, jump to clear hurdles or make a long jump, and perform the relevant arm motion to throw a javelin or discus. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_Tennis">Table Tennis</a> takes place at the Blade Center. Players are required to reach to their left or right to pick up a paddle before serving, and can then incorporate topspin, backspin and smash shots. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. Table Tennis mini games include Paddle Panic, in which the player must take up a paddle in each hand and return as many balls as possible within a fixed time limit, and Rally Tally, where the player is challenged to maintain a single rally for as long as possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer">Soccer</a> takes place at Lotus Park. As an attacker, the player is required to kick the ball to pass or shoot. As a defender, the player is encouraged to move from side to side to block passes and use their full body to block shots. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. Soccer mini games include Super Saver, which puts the player in goal trying to block the striker's shots, and Target Kick, in which the player must beat the goalkeeper and launch the ball at goal-based targets.</p>
