					<p><i><b>Spider-Man 3</b></i> is a 2007 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game">action-adventure game</a> based on the 2007 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_3">of the same name</a>. The game is the sequel to 2004's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2004_video_game)">Spider-Man 2</a></i>, itself based on the 2004 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(film)">of the same name</a>. It was released for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS">Nintendo DS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> on May 4, 2007, and for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> on October 16, 2007. Published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a>, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treyarch">Treyarch</a>, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_Visions">Vicarious Visions</a> handled the development of the other versions, which are drastically different. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beenox">Beenox</a> ported Treyarch's version of the game to Microsoft Windows.</p>

<p>The game plays similarly to two of Treyarch's previous <i>Spider-Man</i> titles, <i>Spider-Man 2</i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></i>, incorporating an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world">open world</a> design that allows players to freely explore a fictitious representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">Manhattan</a> when not completing missions to advance the narrative. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)">symbiote</a> costume from the film is a major gameplay mechanic, increasing Spider-Man's strength and unlocking new abilities. While the game directly adapts the plot of the film, it builds upon it by including additional characters and elements from the Spider-Man comic books and other aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe">Marvel Universe</a>. Most actors reprise their roles from the film, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobey_Maguire">Tobey Maguire</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Franco">James Franco</a> (the first time he does so as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Keaton">Josh Keaton</a> provided Harry's voice in the previous two games), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topher_Grace">Topher Grace</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Haden_Church">Thomas Haden Church</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Simmons">J. K. Simmons</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a>, who played a French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maître_d'">maître d'</a> in the film, narrates the game's tutorial level.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Nintendo DS version, which received mostly positive reviews, <i>Spider-Man 3</i> was met with a mixed critical response. Most of the criticism was aimed at the game's graphics, short length, and technical issues, as well as being too similar to its predecessors. The drastic differences between platforms was another point of criticism. The game was followed in October 2008 by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Web_of_Shadows">Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</a></i>, which has no connections to the <i>Spider-Man</i> film series. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_'em_up">beat 'em up</a> loosely connected to the films, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Friend_or_Foe">Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</a></i>, was published by Activision in October 2007.  Following the expiration of Activision's licensing deal with Marvel, <i>Spider-Man 3</i> was delisted and removed from all digital store fronts on January 4, 2017.</p>

Players take on the role of Spider-Man and complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Missions are structured in a non-linear manner like in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a></i> series, meaning that the game features multiple storylines which can be played in any order the player desires. Once the player has completed a number of missions from each storyline, they unlock a main story mission, related to the plot of the film. In addition to the story missions, the game also features side missions, such as races, combat tours and disarming bombs, as well as random attacks in the streets by the city's gangs, which the player can choose to stop. If a number of gang attacks in a specific district are thwarted, then the gang loses control of that district and attacks will no longer occur there. This crime wave mechanic is also influenced by the story missions and combat tours involving each gang.</p>

<p>Players can web swing, crawl walls, and fight enemies using a variety of combos. The game introduces quick-time events and collectibles, which are scattered throughout the city, including the subway (which is now accessible while free roaming). It also features the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)">symbiote</a> black suit, which is automatically unlocked after a number of story missions and introduces a "rage" mechanic, that is charged up by attacking enemies and allows the player to deal extra damage. In this version, the black suit can not be removed after unlocking it, and will be automatically and permanently removed after reaching a certain point in the story.</p>

<p>The game also features an upgrade system where upgrades are unlocked automatically as the player progresses in the story. In the <i>Collectors Edition</i> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">PlayStation 3</a> version, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Osborn_(2002_film_series_character)">New Goblin</a> is a playable character, similarly to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Osborn_(2002_film_series_character)">Green Goblin</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2002_film)">first game</a>. The New Goblin is also briefly playable in the final mission of the game across all three platforms, and is available as downloadable content for both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network">PlayStation Network</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live">Xbox Live</a>. He can be selected from the game's menu, much like the player can select from regular Spider-Man and black suited Spider-Man once they completed the story with the former. If choosing to play as black suited Spider-Man, then the game starts from the beginning, but all upgrades are unlocked, therefore this essentially serves as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Game_Plus">New Game Plus</a>. If choosing to play as the New Goblin, then none of the story missions are available, but the player can still free roam through the game's map and complete side missions. On PC, the New Goblin is playable only through mods. Peter Parker in his civilian outfit is also playable on PC through mods, and through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch">glitch</a> that prevents progression in certain story missions across all three platforms.</p>

<p>This version of the game plays similarly to its next-gen counterpart, except the combat system is mostly ground-based, like in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(video_game)">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></i>. The main narrative is mostly unchanged, except for several slightly altered missions, while most of the secondary storylines focusing on characters not featured in the film have been removed and replaced with new ones. The map has also suffered a few aesthetic changes due to these consoles' limitations. New <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery">CGI</a> cutscenes are included, in addition to several recycled scenes from the next-gen version. The most notable change in the gameplay is the ability to change between Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume and the black suit at any time through a short quick time event (once the latter is unlocked). During the main storyline, the black suit requires to be removed regularly, because if worn for too long, the symbiote will corrupt Spider-Man, leading to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_over">game over</a>. After removing it, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooldown">cooldown</a> before the black suit can be worn again. After completing the main storyline, the black suit's rage meter will instead deplete to zero percent without killing Spider-Man, once it reaches its limit.</p>

<p>The game features an upgrade system where upgrades need to be manually purchased; there are no upgrades for the black suit. Upgrades are purchased through hero points, similarly to <i>Spider-Man 2</i>, which are unlocked from completing either the main story missions or side missions, including races and combat tours, as well as some that appear randomly across the map. Unlike previous Spider-Man games, these random missions are activated through a radio transmission, allowing the player to accept or decline them, and may vary from stopping muggings to delivering fruit pies. The collectibles and crime wave mechanic from the next-gen version also return, albeit with several modifications. Collectibles, mainly the Spider Emblems, which can be found only during story missions, actually reward the player once found, by unlocking the black suit. The crime wave is now influenced mainly by the combat tours, as there are no longer main story missions involving the gangs. Rather than clearing the city of the gang's influence, the player's goal is to help the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department">NYPD</a> take over, which is depicted as its own "gang", allied to the player, in the menu map.</p>

<p>The primary features for the Wii version are motion controls. By flicking the Wii Remote &amp; Nunchuck, the player can perform various actions such as combat, and one of Spider-Man's trademark abilities, web swinging. There are also certain mini-games tailored to the motion controls. This can range from disarming a bomb, to completing quick time events. The PlayStation Portable version is a full-on port of the PlayStation 2 version with an extra feature exclusive to the version known as "Conquest Mode": an extra mode where the player has to traverse the city and complete challenges such as combat tours, delivering items, and protecting civilians under a time limit. The more challenges are completed, the more hero points the player earns. Once time has elapsed, the score is calculated and the most recent save is loaded; the mission can be replayed any time to get a higher score. Conquest Mode can be exited with a visit to the Daily Bugle building in order to return to the main game. Conquest Mode can be accessed via the title screen or Scrapbook.</p>

<p>The Game Boy Advance version is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_(video_games)">level</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_computer_graphics">2D</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_'em_up">beat 'em up</a>; only the characters are rendered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2.5D">2.5D</a>. A map is used to enter levels, and each level has question bubbles that give hints. The Nintendo DS version is completely 2.5D and uses the Touch Screen to execute most attacks. Players can put on the black suit at will, but it will be disabled if Spider-Man's health is too low. This version supports wireless multiplayer.</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>

<p><i>Spider-Man 3</i> received "generally positive" reviews for the DS version but "mixed or average" reviews for all other platforms, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 2, Wii, and PlayStation Portable versions have been criticized for a short story mode and disappointing graphics, with <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a></i> suggesting that they were technically inferior to the preceding game from 2004.

The Wii version was given a "D+" grade by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(magazine)">The Wire</a></i>.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></i>]</sup> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Play">X-Play</a></i> gave the Wii version 1 out of 5 (the first Wii game to get 1 out of 5), the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions 3 out of 5, and the DS version 4 out of 5.</p>

<p>The game was also criticized for not being the same version on each system. Some criticism has surfaced due to having New Goblin only fully playable in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was also criticized for having a lot of glitches. However, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer">Game Informer</a></i> liked the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of game, giving them an eight out of ten. For the Nintendo DS version, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot">GameSpot</a></i> praised the number of moves, Tobey Maguire's voice acting, and the variety of missions, but criticized the soundtrack.</p>

<p>The game shipped more than 4 million copies.</p>
